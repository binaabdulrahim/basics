Here are some basic git cmds that you can run on VCS terminal to push your repo to Github account
git status --> what changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files are being tracked by Github
git add .  ---> this to add any untracked files 
git commit -m "<commit_message>" --> snapshot of your repo meaning creating a commit
git push ---> used to upload repo content to github
